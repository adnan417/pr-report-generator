1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

   ```ini
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_pat_token
   REPO_OWNER=your_github_username_or_organization
   GROQ_API_KEY=""  # Set the Groq API key (default)
4. **Usage**
   ```bash
   node index backend:your-backend-repo frontend:your-frontend-repo mobile:your-mobile-repo

## Output
After running the script, the output will be saved as a Word document:
```ini
Weekly-PR-Report.docx
```

## LLM Integration
By default, the script uses Groq to fetch key insights from PRs. This is integrated for ease of use.
Make sure you have the Groq API Key in your .env file to enable it. If you wish to use any other LLM,
add its api key in .env file and create a function ai service and use it. An example for OpenRouter has been given
there in the code.
When no LLM is used, the script will log the PR data without fetching key insights.
